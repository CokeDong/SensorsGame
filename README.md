# SensorsGame
We develop one sensors-detection based application called SensorsGame on Android platform. Our game requires users to  make different gestures or activities to change the specific sensor  values if they are attempting to pass each level. The initial object of developing this game is to make the interaction between human and sensor more interesting. In each level, one amusive question will be proposed for users and it might push you over the edge after countless attempts and fails. But once you have found the solutions of the questions, feeling of triumph will prove the brain-racking trials worth. 
# Develop
